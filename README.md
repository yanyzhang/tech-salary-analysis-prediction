This comprehensive anaylsis of compensation data reveals several critical insights:

Technical Dominance: Technical leadership roles, particularly Software Engineering Manager and Technical Program Manager, have the highest compensation packages, with total compensation reaching up with $2.18 million annually.

Geographic Premiums: San Fransisco and Seattle emerge as the highest-paying regions, with compensation 2-3 times higher than national averages for comparable roles.

Company Strategies: Major technology companies (Facebook, Google, Linkedlin) dominate the high-compensation landscape, with innovative compensation structures heavily weighted toward stock-based incentives.

Experience differences: While experience generally correlates higher compensation, some high-experience roles in traditional industries show lower compensation than less-experienced roles. The experience premium varise significantly by industry and role type. This suggests that skill type and market demand may outweigth pure experience

Market Dynamic: Jobs in technology based in big tech cities earn much higher pay. Meanwhile, regular jobs in other industries are seeing only small raises.

Base Salary Prediction: ears of experience and years in the company increase the base salary, but years at level decreases it. I should consider adding more features to improve the accuracy of the prediction.

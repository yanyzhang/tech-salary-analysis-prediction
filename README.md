# [Tech Compensation Market Trends & Predictive Modeling] 
*(例如: Tech Compensation Market Trends & Predictive Modeling)*

## 📌 Project Objective
Analyzed a comprehensive dataset of **20,000+ salary records** to identify industry compensation trends and build a predictive model estimating compensation based on location, role, and experience.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Data Processing & Analysis:** Pandas
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## 📊 Key Market Insights

This comprehensive analysis of compensation data reveals several critical industry trends:

* **Technical Dominance:** Technical leadership roles, particularly Software Engineering Managers and Technical Program Managers, command the highest compensation packages. In some cases, total compensation (TC) reaches up to **$2.18 million annually**.
* **Geographic Premiums:** San Francisco and Seattle emerge as the highest-paying regions. Compensation in these tech hubs is often **2-3 times higher** than the national average for comparable roles.
* **Company Strategies:** Major technology companies (e.g., Meta/Facebook, Google, LinkedIn) dominate the high-compensation landscape. Their innovative compensation structures are heavily weighted toward stock-based incentives (RSUs).
* **Experience Discrepancies:** While experience generally correlates with higher compensation, the "experience premium" varies significantly by industry and role type. High-experience roles in traditional industries sometimes show lower compensation than less-experienced tech roles, suggesting that **skill type and market demand outweigh pure years of experience**.
* **Market Dynamics:** There is a growing divide in the market. Technology-focused jobs in major tech hubs continue to see rapid pay increases, while traditional roles in other industries are experiencing only marginal wage growth.

## 🤖 Base Salary Prediction Model

As part of this project, a predictive model was developed to estimate base salaries. 

**Current Model Findings:**
* **Positive Correlation:** `Years of Experience` and `Years at Company` generally increase the predicted base salary.
* **Negative Correlation:** Interestingly, `Years at Current Level` shows a slight negative impact on base salary, potentially highlighting wage compression or the financial penalty of not being promoted quickly.

**🚀 Future Work:**
* Integrate additional features (e.g., education level, specific tech skills, company tier) to improve the model's predictive accuracy and $R^2$ score.
* Deploy the final Scikit-Learn model via a web API on GCP for real-time salary estimations.
